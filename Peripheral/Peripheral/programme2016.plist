		<string>IntensiveWorkshop</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>This is a design and technology workshop – in equal parts. It will focus on one of the most intimate kinds of technology, the wearable. We will use design thinking methods, rapid prototyping and human centered technology to push the boundaries and create a collection of wearable prototypes.
The origins of wearables stems from both ubiquitous computing and the quantified self. Its history includes the first calculator watch in the 80s all the way to holographic optics used in the military. And yet the world of the wearable seems to have really only just begun for most technologists and designers. Fitness trackers, notification jewellery, VR headsets, or basic controllers barely scratch the surface of what is really possible.
This technology can be inclusive and exclusive; can save lives and waste time; can cost anything from 5€ to 30,000€.
The workshop will create the circumstances to test your ideas and abilities – and extend them! The results could form the beginnings of big projects, boundary pushing ideas, or even become a lifelong mission.
 
Curated in collaboration with European Lab.</string>

		<key>programme</key>
		<string>IntensiveWorkshop</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>Ever had the chance to design an interactive experience for 28 iPads? Now you do. M-O is a new interactive installation that, at its core, is a distributed multitouch screen made up of over two dozen tablets that wirelessly synchronizes interaction and animations across all its screens. For this year’s festival we’re open-sourcing a new artwork we’ve designed, and will be giving you the opportunity to dig into, tear apart, and rebuild your own artwork for M-O.
We will start with an introduction to C4, a creative-coding framework that focuses on interaction, animation and media for iOS, and then dive into the infrastructure that makes it possible to build an interactive work on multiple tablets, including animations that can span all screens, and how they communicate with one another. Along the way we’ll provide instruction on how to program, test, debug and – most importantly – design media for presentation on M-O.
After learning how to build basic examples with C4 and design shapes / components using programs like PaintCode, we’re going to hand over to you all the classes, components, and media we’ve used to create our new artwork and give you free reign to build your own Universe for M-O.
P.S. If we get really advanced, we’ll show you how to control M-O from an iPhone.</string>

Computer sciences neglected visual programming mostly criticising its ack of readability and scalability and the fact that programming metaphors like object-orientation can not be expressed well and compact in a visual form.
With vvvv we’ve been on a mission to tackle those issues for around 15 years. In April 2015 we released a preview of VL, our new approach to visual programming that we claim will solve many of the known problems and open visual programming to a wider range of audiences.</string>

		<string>IntensiveWorkshop</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>ARM processors are ubiquitous in mobile devices and in an ever increasing number of embedded devices, with RISC processors making a comeback in low power computing environments. With major operating systems (incl. Linux, iOS and Android) choosing to run on these processors, understanding the low level operations of these processors can serve to better understand, optimize and debug software stacks running on them.
This workshop will introduce you to the exciting world of programming ARM embedded devices outside the world of Arduino, working ‘baremetal’ with the powerful ARM Cortex-M processor family. We will use the STM32F746 discovery board (included in workshop fee), the first device featuring the latest and most powerful CPU in the Cortex-M family. After an introduction to generic ARM hardware and baremetal (no OS!) topics, including basic examples demonstrating how to work with core peripherals of the board, we’ll then start using C libraries from the thi.ng project (to be announced) and learn to create a few fully featured applications based on our own programmable, polyphonic stereo synthesizer and a multi-track MIDI step sequencer with interactive touchscreen GUIs to control the instrument – all of which you can take home later. This is not just going to be a lo-fi noise box! Furthermore, with the help from a little studio gear, we will be able to jam together as band and strive to do some recording on the last day.
Source code scaffolding will be provided to maximize time for experimentation.</string>

All you need is electronics to structure electricity. If you can give structure to electricity, you can make sound. In this workshop we’re going to learn how this works by building two simple synthesizers which you can take home with you. You’ll learn the building blocks of controlling current, building logic, and creating sound, and everyone will receive a 3d printed controller box and and all the electronics needed to make a two small synths that can be powered off of a 9V battery.</string>

		<string>ABCD was conceived as a participative sound performance and done in Berlin, Braga, Hailuoto, Athens and Bern, and it will be staged as an intensive workshop with local students for the first time at Resonate.
While these performances were mostly taking part during music and sound art festivals, with a spontaneous participation of the audience, this particular workshop will give the students detailed introduction into the history and the specificity of two-way and cardinal radio communication offered by walkie-talkie devices. The focus of the workshop is a common creation of a radio form which relies on both spontaneous and mutually conceived, sound and linguistic narrative – at, and around Kalemegdan fortress.</string>

		<string>What I hear, I forget.
What I see, I remember.
What I do, I understand.
 
When experimenting with various materials and technology in the studio, we are drawn to use space and time both as a material and an inspiration.
This workshop helps you awaken new understandings of time and space using senses of your body.
During the workshop, we will use only black pencil, charcoal, paint, papers to visualise different types of music, draw length of time, understand perspectives and Synesthesia and realise wisdom inside the body beyond the rational mind alone.
It’s not about deep speculating but more finding joy in being observant, unawareness and self-forgetting.

The module is specifically designed for wide usability, for people who are just starting out the modular journey, people who work with non-modular setups and for ones who already have a eurorack system. In each workshop you will receive a kit with a step by step manual and necessary parts.
You don’t need any experience in electronics as we will start from scratch, teaching soldering and follow the build manual together, step by step.
The Resonate 2016 module is purposefully designed Tactile Noise Generator which uses finger contact to produce sounds from Low Frequency to High Frequency Noise. In addition, sound oscillations are converted to tension and provide a CV Output from 0V to 4V, which can be used for control of other modules, synthesizers or DIY guitar pedals.
This module is designed as a Modular Synth DIY and can use any Eurorack compatible power supply or by a single 9V battery or adapter.
The Tools are provided and the price of the workshop is included in the price of the module that we supply.
The Workshop will not teach you everything about making your own modular synthesizer, but you’ll learn enough to have a nice start, distinguish components, learn basics of soldering, and how to populate printed circuit boards.
But be careful: Modular Synthesis is highly addictive!!!</string>

		<string>Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith’s formative years were spent communing with nature on Orcas Island in the northwest region of Washington state, a place she describes as “one of the most magical and peaceful places I have ever been.” Though she wouldn’t begin experimenting with modular synthesis until many years later, her creative work continues to be infused with and inspired by the vitality and serenity of Orcas.
Smith left the island to attend Berklee College of Music, where she studied composition and sound engineering, initially focusing on her voice as her primary instrument, before switching to classical guitar and piano. She employed many of the skills she refined in college in her indie-folk band Ever Isles, but a fateful encounter with a neighbor who lent her a Buchla 100 synthesizer, had a profound effect on her. Mesmerized by the Buchla’s potential, she explains “I got so distracted and enamored with the process of making sounds with it that I abandoned the next Ever Isles album.” Starting with rhythmic patterns and melodic pulses, she soon began sculpting lush and exciting worlds of sound.</string>

		<string>Hans-Joachim Roedelius is a German experimental, ambient and electronic musician. He is best known as a co-founder of the krautrock groups Cluster and Harmonia and for his work in the ambient jazz trio Aquarello.
Kluster, Cluster and Harmonia
In 1968 Roedelius co-founded the music commune known as “Human Being” and co-formed Zodiak Free Arts Lab, the center of Berlin’s Underground Culture at the time, with conceptual artist Conrad Schnitzler. He met Dieter Moebius at the Zodiak. In 1970 Roedelius, Schnitzler and Moebius formed Kluster. In 1971 Schnitzler left the group to start a long-running solo career and Moebius and Roedelius anglicised the band’s name to Cluster. At first Cluster worked along the same lines as their parent group, signed first to Philips then to Brain.
In 1973 Roedelius and Moebius worked with Neu! guitarist Michael Rother for the first time. Rother helped to co-produce their third album, Zuckerzeit, that moved the band’s style further from avant-garde ‘noise’ to a more melodic music, similar to modern-daytrance. Roedelius, Moebius and Rother toured Germany and the Low Countries as a trio from early 1973 and decided to record an album together under the name of Harmonia. Musik von Harmonia was released on the back of a huge publicity campaign by Brain. Harmonia released one further album initially, 1975’s Deluxe. British musician Brian Eno, a fan of both Cluster and Harmonia, joined them for several jams, the result of which was released in 1997 as Tracks &amp; Traces. Rother left Harmonia to pursue his solo career and Cluster returned to the studio to record Sowiesoso which was released on Sky Records. Brian Eno, who had returned to Germany to work with David Bowie, worked on two albums with Cluster: 1977’s Cluster &amp; Eno and 1978’s After the Heat, the latter of which gained the band much attention in the British music press. A further Cluster album produced by former Tangerine Dream member Peter Baumann Großes Wasser extended Cluster’s music into long form.
Solo career
Roedelius’ solo career began with Durch die Wüste in 1978 and then Jardin au Fou in 1979. This album laid down Roedelius’ future style: melodic piano and (often faked) acoustic instruments played with a sharp tinge of electronics. The first of the lengthy Selbstportrait series was released in 1979, being material done beside his work with Cluster and Harmonia, without the input of his collaborators. Recorded on only two tracks, the Selbstportraits make up the backbone of Roedelius’ early solo recordings. Leaving Sky in 1982, his work took a more new-age style as he signed to Virgin’s Venture sub-label. During this period, his best selling solo album Geschenk des Augenblicks – Gift of the Moment was released.
He was dropped by Venture in 1989 and began releasing on a variety of small labels, notably Multimood and Prudence. He began to venture into the newly emerging genre oftechno, starting with 1991’s Der Ohrenspiegel, whose 25-minute opener, Reflectorum displays some of the characteristics of the later Sinfonia Contempora series. By 1994 Roedelius’ style was a heady mix of amateur electronics and sometimes cliched ambient jazz. An album from this year; Theatreworks, was rewarded with the title “album of the month” by experimental music magazine The Wire. Arguably the biggest turning point in Roedelius’ career came in 1994 as well. The release of Sinfonia Contempora No. 1: Von Zeit zu Zeit marked, in Roedelius’ own words, “Since the beginning of my career nothing was more important to me than to find my own musical language. I have, so I believe, eventually found it.” The album consists of mismatched tape fragments (from numerous jams ranging from the mid-eighties to the mid-nineties) multitracked over the top of each other to create a disjointed but oddly musical sound.
Sinfonia Contempora No. 2: La Nordica (Salz Des Nordens) was released in 1996, making for a much more sinister and muddy sound than its predecessor. Also released in this period was Selbstportrait VI: The Diary of the Unforgotten, the first of the modern Selbstportraits. Now, rather than merely remastering the seventies tapes, Roedelius also played over them, the sound montage Homage á Forst samples many Harmonia and Cluster tracks into the mix.
Reformation of Cluster
In the meantime, Cluster had reformed. 1990’s Apropos Cluster was an update for the band, being a work of avant-techno not dissimilar in style to Großes Wasser. In 1996 Cluster embarked on two international tours, one of Japan and one of America. Both tours would be summarised on the following years live albums. The new sound of Cluster learns from the Sinfonia Contempora sound whilst adding Moebius’ distinctive sound.
21st century: solo work and collaborations
The turn of the century was Roedelius’ most productive year, with no less than eight albums being released between 2000 and 2001. Reprising the Selbstportrait series for the seventh time in 2000, Roedelius composed entirely new tracks for the first time on Selfportrait VII: dem Wind voran – ahead of the wind. The new millennium also saw Roedelius begin to work with other, usually younger, musicians than he had done since the late eighties.
Another series is Lieder vom Steinfeld. Begun in 1995, Roedelius recites poems over these pieces, primarily in his native German language. In 2001 Roedelius worked with Conrad Schnitzler again for the first time since 1971. The record “Acon I”has been released in Japan by “Capt.Trip-Records .
Roedelius had been growing substantially in fame since Cluster began touring again in 1996. He is often cited by electronic musicians and releases several albums a year, many of which are collaborations with modern musicians who are fans. He works extensively with Tim Story and released Fibre recorded with Jez Coad, Martin Barker and Georg Taylor an album which has reached 13th place in “the Third Uncut Playlist of 2009” for Uncut Magazine, ahead of Bruce Springsteen’s Working on a Dream.
Qluster
In November 2010 it was announced that Cluster had split up for the third time. In the official announcement, the split up was described as Moebius leaving the group. In the wake of this news, Roedelius announced that he was beginning a new project called Qluster, to follow on from Cluster and Kluster. The band is made up of Roedelius and accomplished electronic musician Onnen Bock with third member Armin Metz and released a trilogy consisting of “Rufen”, “Fragen” and “Antworten” (Calling, Asking andAnswering) in 2011. The then released a recording of a live concert made at CTM-Festival in Berlin, titled “Lauschen” ( Listening ).</string>

		<string>Pierre Bastien: Where music and mechanics collide (FR / Rephlex / Morphine).
Pierre Bastien’s is a french gentleman born 1953 who builds his own machineries, at the cross between music and visual art, that blends live trumpet sounds with screen projections of on-site, mechanical sound sculptures in a very poetic way. His work is described as “a timeless sounding orchestra, both futuristic and slightly dada, conjuring ancient traditions in its surprisingly sensuous music.”
Bastien has been called a “mad musical scientist with a celebrity following” by The Guardian. Collaborating in the past with filmmaker Pierrick Sorin, fashion designer Issey Miyake, singer and composer Robert Wyatt and Aphex Twin (who released three of his albums on his label Rephlex) to name a few, he is one of the most influential experimental musicians working in the field. In 1986 he formed his own self made one man orchestra, Mecanium and made over 20 records over the years. Pierre’s new album is just released via Morphine Records on Nov 24th 2015.</string>

Pop Grenade has been described by Irvine Welsh as “an amazing collection of tales of inspirational courage and madness from the front line of popular culture”.
At Resonate ’16, he’ll be discussing how music has been used as a political tool in the new media era by both freedom fighters and authoritarian governments.
Matthew has also worked as a foreign correspondent for the BBC, Al Jazeera and Agence France-Presse, and as editor for The Big Issue, i-D magazine, the Time Out website and the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network.

		<string>With his band Atari Teenage Riot and his label Digital Hardcore, Alec Empire was a pivotal figure in the politicisation of early 90’s rave culture.
Empire’s ‘Low On Ice’ (The Icelandic Sessions) is a unique monument of atmospheric poignancy and sonic radicalism. It was created in 1994 in a single session in Iceland when, immediately after a festival appearance with Atari Teenage Riot, Empire “drove with buzzing ears to the great outdoors, seeking an exact opposite experience” in which to experiment with minimalist analogue electronic hardware.
This new audiovisual live performance has been created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of this seminal point in electronic music, and features a new collaboration with laptop performer, violinist and and video artist Zan Lyons.</string>

		<string>Daniel Miller is the founder of Mute, launched in 1978 with his own 7” single – ‘Warm Leatherette’ under the name The Normal.
Since then, Mute has grown from Miller’s one-man operation into a global group of companies and today, as ever, Miller remains heavily focussed on Mute’s creative output.
Although he DJed many years ago, Daniel Miller’s recent DJing was inspired by an invitation from Karl O’Connor aka Regis who invited him to perform at a Sandwell District event at Berlin’s Berghain. There he caught the bug to play again and since has been playing regular techno  sets worldwide including Sonar, ENTER at Space in Ibiza, ADE in Amsterdam, IMS at Ibiza, Electron festival, LEAF festival in London as well as at Culture Box in Copenhagen, Bootleg in Tel Aviv and, of course, a legendary performance at M-Nus’ Christmas Boiler Room in Berlin.</string>

		<string>Join this workshop to assemble, program and play on your own CFO synthesizer.
Over the course of the last years the VSIONHAIRIES team has been building the CFO platform for DIY digital sound synthesis on cheap, physical, custom made PCBs (http://vsionhairies.info).
The BODYSEQ synth combines a bare metal step sequencer interface with simple controllers for live performance in order to provide a cheap, easily programmable interface for adding your own sounds to your electronic music setup.
Using a newly developed, more modular synthesis framework, the 1-day workshop will focus on taking participants through the steps of: soldering up a synthesizer (easy); programming it with a set of predefined modules (easy); and give an introduction to make and integrate your own oscillators, filters, envelopes, etc. (advanced). Mixing different modules the BODYSEQ can play as a monophonic synth, chord-based harmonic generator or sample-based drum machine/sequencer.
At the end of the workshop we will connect all the newly build synths to each other and play together through the platform’s MIDI and sync capabilities.
Workshop leaders Jakob Bak and Dennis P. Paul collaborated last year at Resonate’15 on the work Automatic Orchestra, that utilised the synth framework to have 12 individual synthesizers play generative compositions together through networked interactions (https://vimeo.com/151840478). The same engine is here updated for greater flexibility and ease of use.</string>

		<key>description</key>
		<string>« Mapping the Internet poses numerous problems. The challenge is not just that it contains a staggering amount of extremely complex, rapidly-changing information, but also that it exists nowhere and yet operates simultaneously in the physical world. To be more precise: the Internet produces a new type of space time that bears a loose and flexible relationship to the world. The word “space” in “cyberspace” is highly metaphoric and cannot be separated from the activity conducted within it because the activity is what produces this “space”. » — Dirk van Welden in Else/Where: Mapping New Cartographies of Networks and Territories
As we can’t map the Internet, we will approach this question from a local/household scale. Indeed, cyberspace exists around us: we are surrounded by electromagnetic waves carrying our data. However, we can’t see (or feel) it, apart from what our screens show, which is in fact just the tip of the iceberg. This workshop aims to show this invisible spectrum of data superimposed onto our physical world, inhabiting our public and privates spaces. To achieve this we will focus on a well-known domestic object: a wireless router.
Participants will first learn to catch and parse raw data from an open wireless access point. From which, each participant will produce a map or visualization in order to expose and show the realities of this invisible landscape of ever-changing data waving around us.</string>

		<key>programme</key>
		<string>Conference</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>Are you interested in creating live interactions with sensors, cameras, game controllers, or microphones? Machine learning can be a fast and empowering tool to connect these inputs to outputs such as animation, sounds, robots, game engines, or even custom-built physical computing systems. While it might sound like you need a degree in computer science to try out this technique, it is actually much easier than you’d think.
For example, imagine you are building an interaction using an Arduino with some sensors to control sound when a dancer moves around a space. Instead of writing a computer program to specify which sound to play based on the sensor values, you can simply use machine learning to record the data the sensors output when the dancer moves, and provide a set of example sounds to trigger when the dancer makes those gestures. A machine learning tool can then learn how you want the sound to change based on the movement over time.
In this way, machine learning makes it possible to quickly build expressive interactions that aren’t possible to create using only programming. Also, it makes it easy for non-programmers to design and customize interactive environments.
In this workshop, we’ll give you a hands-on introduction to using machine learning for creating interactive art, music, games, and other real-time systems. Using the Wekinator (http://www.wekinator.org/), created by the course’s instructor Rebecca Fiebrink, we will cover an introduction to using machine learning for creative practice. This free and cross-platform software tool connects a wide variety of existing hardware and software (e.g., Arduino, Unity 3D, Max/MSP, PD, Ableton, openFrameworks, Processing, Kinect, Bitalino, …) using OpenSoundControl (OSC). Expect to learn the basics of a few standard techniques to help you get started integrating machine learning into your own projects.</string>

		<string>This workshops aims to offer tools, resources and creative approaches for realtime control of standard DMX lighting equipment. This knowledge open the doors for creating innovative stage designs or interactive installations.
After a brief overview on some case studies, and by understanding lighting protocols such as DMX, Artnet, and network communication protocols as OSC, we can create tools that enable live usability of moving head lights, RGB Par Leds, stroboscopes…
On this workshop we’ll work with Max/MSP and OpenFrameworks to develop, modify and use software that will allow us control lighting fixtures through Low Frequency Oscillators and Time-lining.</string>

		<key>description</key>
		<string>Modern 3D graphics programming has advanced a lot in the last decades, and WebGL provides now easy access to the power of the GPU using JavaScript and a browser. The cornerstone of the programming capabilities are shaders, programs that tell the GPU how to display images on screen. WebGL shaders are written in GLSL, a relatively simple language with amazing possibilities. We’ll go through the programmable pipeline of modern GPUs, running shader code in the browser with WebGL, the operations available in GLSL and how to use them to display mind blowing graphics and make slow tasks blazing fast by harvesting the power of parallel computing on the GPU. At the end of the workshop we’ll try to combine all the participants work into a single demo, and create a collaborative audiovisual experience.</string>

		<string>Openframe is an open source platform for artists, curators, and art enthusiasts to experiment with new art forms and new ways of displaying and interacting with digital art. The platform consists of an API and extensible frame controller software that allows anyone to set up a frame using a display and a Raspberry Pi.
During the first part of the workshop we’ll learn about Openframe. We’ll discuss how the project came about, how the platform works, how to setup and interact with a frame, and how to create extensions. During the second half of the workshop Patricio will give an introduction to shaders based on his Book of Shaders and show how to push them into an Openframe. In this part we’ll cover the principles behind glsl shaders, how to create algorithmic compositions, and how to animate them.</string>

		<string>Trained as an architect, Pablo Garcia’s recent work has evolved from design-for-hire to internationally exhibited artworks, provocations and research studies. Born in 1975, Garcia was in college when the first internet browser launched. Composite training in traditional analog and then-nascent digital technologies inspired a research practice into the intersection and overlap of art and technology, obsolescence and the cutting edge, the real and the virtual. Garcia’s work ranges from scholarly contributions to art historical studies to contemporary artworks examining digital culture.
His expertise in the history and technique of drawing technologies has contributed to research for institutions such as The Art Institute of Chicago, The American Philosophical Society, The Polytechnic Museum (Moscow), and The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (London). Garcia’s work has been exhibited in galleries and festivals across North America, South America, and Europe. His work has also been featured in the most widely-read journals in the world, including Art in America, WIRED, FastCompany, Huffington Post, GQ, Mashable. Garcia’s Core77 Award winning NeoLucida (in collaboration with Golan Levin) was among the Top 100 highest grossing Kickstarter campaigns of all time. Previously, Garcia has taught at Carnegie Mellon University, Parsons School of Design, and The University of Michigan. He holds degrees in architecture from Cornell and Princeton Universities. Universities.

		<string>Romain Tardy is a visual artist, and focuses his work primarily in digital arts.
Born on September 23, 1984, in Paris, he studied at the ecole des Beaux-Arts before working for various animation and post-production studios in Paris. He also worked as a VJ at numerous events in France and across Europe, which led him to further examine the complex connections between sound and image. With this experience,Tardy, along with three other artists, created the European visual label Antivj in 2008, which formed the base of his research and work on projected light and its in uence on perception. He remained one of the label’s main artists until late 2013.
His installations, which often use the technique of videomapping, are conceived as tangible experiences in situ and use light as a way to enhance existing architecture or original structures. By examining our relationship to reality as we are confronted by computer imagery and the social changes that it triggers, as well as the way that digital technology is situated in public space,Tardy’s installations seek to evoke these current issues through a poetic approach. His work has been exhibited in more than 15 countries, including France, Sweden,The Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, UK, Czech Republic, Belgium, China, South Korea, Japan, Mexico, USA (New York), Cuba…</string>

		<string>James Auger is a designer, researcher and lecturer whose work examines the social, cultural and personal impact of technology and the products that exist as a result of its development and application.
On graduating from Design Products (MA) at the Royal College of Art in 2001 James moved to Dublin to conduct research at the Media Lac Europe (MLE) exploring the theme of human communication as mediated by technology. After MLE he worked in Tokyo as guest designer at the Issey Miyake Design Studio developing new concepts for mobile telephones. Between 2005 and 2015 James was part of the critically acclaimed Design Interactions department at the RCA, teaching on the MA programme and continuing his development of critical and speculative approaches to design, design research and technology, completing his PhD on the subject in 2012.
Running parallel to his academic work James is half of the speculative design practice Auger-Loizeau, a collaboration founded in 2000. Auger-Loizeau projects have been published and exhibited internationally, including MoMA, New York; 21_21, Tokyo; The Science Museum, London; The National Museum of China, Beijing and Ars Electronice, Linz. Their work is in the permanent collection at MoMA.
James recently moved to Portugal to conduct research at the Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute. He plans to explore the potential of the Island as an experimental laboratory through a combination of fictional, factual, functional and hypothetical multi-scale proposals and projects.</string>

		<string>We are a team of visual artists, developers and engineers, creating experiences that blur the boundaries between art, design and technology, the physical and the nonphysical. We work in a wide range of disciplines including interactive installations, online platforms and animation. We see these continuously evolving technologies as access points to a holistic brand experience, always as a result of a concept.
Our studio is an environment that invites creativity and exploration. We don’t work with frameworks, blueprints, or an agency signature; we work with the values of a brand and our intuition: Sensing the pulse of contemporary culture, embracing the unexpected. The international team of Random Studio mirrors the diversity of disciplines, nationalities and cultures. With the history of a production company we know how to produce things in the virtual and the real world.
Current fields of interest include the advancement of the retail space, the exploration of virtual reality and the development of digital products.

Starting to play with web technologies in the early 2000s, his design practice aims to reflect the blurry boundaries of visual communication at a digital age. From experimental interactive projects to institutional communication, from Art installation to commercial product design, he likes to produce dedicated design solution relayed by dubious self-made tools to achieve unexpected visual experience in a large range of disciplines.
This experimental and playful way to work gave him the opportunity to create unique projects with musicians (Breakbot, Philippe Cohen-Solal/Gotan Project), cultural institutions (Gaîte Lyrique, Van Gogh museum, Google Cultural Institute), plasticians (Mrzyk &amp; Moriceau) or commercial brands (Chanel, Hermes, Samsung) among others.

		<string>Karsten Schmidt is an award-winning London based computational designer and researcher merging code, design, art &amp; craft skills. Originally from East Germany and starting in the deep end of the early 8-bit demo scene, for the past 25+ years he’s been adopting a completely trans-disciplinary way of working and has been laterally involved in a wide range of creative disciplines. With his practice PostSpectacular, he’s been actively exploring current possibilities at the intersection of design, art, software development and education and applying this mixture hands-on to a variety of fields, from architecture, branding, digital fabrication, interactive installations, motion graphics &amp; music. A strong conceptual thinker and always striving for maximum creative freedom, Karsten’s design approach is based on treating ideas as malleable software at the heart, which in turn informs all other facets of each project.
When not creating, he regularly travels the world consulting, lecturing and teaching workshops about code literacy, open source and employing code as creative tool. He is a prolific contributor to several large open source projects, was an early contributor to the Processing.org project and to several books about programming and graphic design. His work has been featured and exhibited internationally, including the MoMA New York, Design Museum, Barbican Centre and Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

		<string>Refik Anadol is a media artist and director born in Istanbul, Turkey. Currently lives and works in Los Angeles, California. He is a lecturer in UCLA’s Department of Design Media Arts.
He is working in the fields of site-specific public art with parametric data sculpture approach and live audio/visual performance with immersive installation approach, particularly his works explore the space among digital and physical entities by creating a hybrid relationship between architecture and media arts.
As a media artist, designer and spatial thinker, Refik Anadol is intrigued by the ways in which the transformation of the subject of contemporary culture requires rethinking of the new aesthetic, technique and dynamic perception of space. Anadol builds his works on the nomadic subject’s reaction to and interactions with unconventional spatial orientations. Embedding media arts into architecture, he questions the possibility of a post digital architectural future in which there are no more non-digital realities. He invites the viewers to visualize alternative realities by presenting them the possibility of re-defining the functionalities of both interior and exterior architectural formations. Anadol’s work suggests that all spaces and facades have potentials to be utilized as the media artists’ canvases.
He has been given awards, residencies and has served as a guest lecturer. He is the recipient of a number of awards, prizes including Microsoft Research’s Best Vision Awards, UCLA Art+Architecture Moss Awards, The University of California Institute for Research in the Arts Awards and CODAvideo Awards. His site-specific audio/visual performances have been seen in Walt Disney Concert Hall (USA), Hammer Museum (USA), International Digital Arts Biennial Montreal (Canada), Ars Electronica Festival (Austria), l’Usine | Genève (Switzerland), Arc De Triomf (Spain), Zollverein | SANAA’s School of Design Building (Germany), santralistanbul Contemporary Art Center (Turkey), Outdoor Vision Festival SantaFe New Mexico (USA), Istanbul Design Biennial (Turkey), Sydney City Art (Australia), Lichtrouten (Germany).

		<string>Tom “Squarepusher” Jenkinson makes manic, schizoid, experimental drum’n’bass with a heavy progressive jazz influence and a lean toward pushing the cliches of the genre out the proverbial window. Rising from near-total obscurity to drum’n’bass cause celèbre in the space of a couple of months, Jenkinson released only a pair of EPs and a DJ Food remix for the latter’s Refried Food series before securing EP and LP release plans with three different labels. His first full-length work, Feed Me Weird Things (on Richard “Aphex Twin” James’ Rephlex label), was a dizzying, quixotic blend of super-fast jungle breaks with Aphex-style synth textures, goofy, offbeat melodies, and instrumental arrangements (he samples his own playing for his tracks) that vaguely recall jazz fusion pioneers such as Mahavishnu Orchestra and Weather Report. A skilled bassist and multi-instrumentalist, Jenkinson’s fretless accompaniment is a staple of his music and one of the more obvious affiliations with jazz (although his formal arrangements are often as jazz-derived as his playing).
Jenkinson grew up listening to jazz and dub greats like Miles Davis, Augustus Pablo, Charlie Parker, and Art Blakey. The son of a jazz drummer, Jenkinson followed in his father’s footsteps, playing bass and drums in high school. Introduced to electronic music through experimental electro-techno artists such as LFO and Carl Craig, Jenkinson soon began assembling his disparate influences into amalgams of breakbeat techno and post-bop avant-garde and progressive jazz. Claiming a closer affinity with jazz than jungle (although he draws from both equally in his music), Jenkinson’s EPs as Squarepusher and the Duke of Harringay (Jenkinson moved to Harringay from his Chelmsford birthplace) were initially disregarded as misplaced perversions of jungle’s more obvious compositional principles, but found ready audiences in fans of post-acid house experimental listening music. He inked a deal with Warp in 1995, releasing the Port Rhombus EP and three others through a variety of different labels. The aforementioned full-length Feed Me Weird Things appeared in 1996, followed a year later by Hard Normal Daddy.
Critical acclaim for Jenkinson’s work peaked with 1998’s Music Is Rotted One Note, for which he became a one-man fusion group — multi-tracking himself playing drums, bass, and keyboards. The following year, he released two EPs (Budakhan Mindphone, Maximum Priest) and another full LP, Selection Sixteen. Go Plastic appeared in summer 2001, featuring the closest thing to a hit Squarepusher had ever seen with the single “My Red Hot Car.” Subsequent releases such as 2003’s Do You Know Squarepusher and 2004’s Ultravisitor found him refining his fusion of composition, programming, and musicianship, characteristics that were also heard on 2006’s Hello Everything and 2008’s Just a Souvenir. After a record of solo bass (titled Solo Electric Bass, Vol. 1), he unveiled his next project, a masked foursome named Shobaleader One that released a 2010 collaboration album (Shobaleader One: D’demonstrator) consisting of throwback electronic pop with an R&amp;B edge and synthesized vocals, not unlike Daft Punk. In 2012, Jenkinson returned with the coldly symphonic Ufabulum, adding an apocalyptic soundtrack feel to his already dense programming. In 2013, he worked with a team of Japanese roboticists on an ambitious project called Z-Machines, the creation of robots that could play music far beyond the capabilities of even the most skilled human instrumentalists. Jenkinson aided the robotics team in the composition of music for these robots to play, set to life by a 22-armed drumming robot and a guitar-playing robot with the equivalent of 78 fingers. The next year, Warp Records released the Music for Robots EP, a five-song recording of the results of the experiment. 2015 saw the release of Damogen Furies, a full-length that found Jenkinson pushing the limits of even his own unbridled hysteria, employing punishing overdriven tones on almost every beat, synth, and bassline on the album.</string>

		<string>The European Network for Contemporary Audiovisual Creation aims to foster innovation based on a combination of the knowledge, experience and resources of its members, an interdisciplinary and complementary vision. Their contribution to the process of creators, in the fields of research, production, education and dissemination of the new audiovisual practices will result in a more effective implementation of innovative solutions that can be exported, that are sustainable and that bring the new audiovisual culture closer to the general public and to the audiovisual industry. Furthermore, the network will foster interaction and collaborative work among European creators/developers fostering and boosting intermedia research.Training is considered a strategic pillar of this project at different levels with the purpose of boosting the capabilities of creators reinforcing and supporting their knowledge and skills thus extending their contribution to the various creative and cultural industries and, with the firm purpose of extending the critical mass and bringing these practices closer to a larger audience, based on collective participation and critical reflection through actions that make us re-think the environment that we inhabit. Furthermore, the aim is to explore how these advancements can develop and trascend to industries that are not merely cultural or creative. 6 European partners from 5 countries (Spain, France, Serbia, Germany and Austria) and 4 non-European collaborating partners based in Switzerland, Canada and Mexico, the project will include the following actions: 20 research and production residencies, 12 series of expert training workshops, 2 developer and creator meetings and 24 public presentations of the results by means of performances, installations and/or exhibitions, in addition to talks, conferences and round tables to share the processes and debate important issues for the network and its audiences.</string>

		<string>Patricio Gonzalez Vivo is an artist and engineer who uses code and light to turn data into stunning landscapes. His landscapes address the problem of scale and the development of technology to perceive beyond the world in front of us. This technology helps us to see where our eyes are otherwise blind, pushing our cognitive limits. Patricio’s landscapes are not just representations of space but compositions of time and perception. Although his work is technically sophisticated his process is driven by curiosity and playful tinkering. Binoculars, telescopes, astrolabes, compasses, grids, maps, and photographs are some of the apparatus that trigger his imagination.
Patricio’s work has been shown at FILE Festival (2012, 2013), Espacio Fundación Telefónica, and FASE. He was a MediaLab resident at Centro Cultural Español. Patricio currently makes open source mapping tools at Mapzen. His work has been featured in Gizmodo, The Atlantic, and Fast Company. He developed visual systems for the interactive Clouds documentary. He teaches at Parsons, where he received his MFA in Design and Technology.
Patricio lives in Brooklyn and Buenos Aires. In his previous life he was a clinical psychologist and art therapist. He believes in developing a better together.</string>

		<string>Daniel Sciboz (b. 1973, Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland)

Trained as a graphic designer I graduated in 1995 and worked for studios including Atelier Roger Pfund in Geneva

and Weiersmüller Bosshard Grüninger WBG in Zürich. In 2001 I started studying Media Design at Geneva University of Art

and Design and completed in 2006 a MA Degree in Contemporary Arts and New Media at University Paris 8. My research

focused on artistic usage of Global Positioning System, including the design and production of a series of interactive-video

essays entitled GPS-Movies, mixing GPS data with digital video. I was granted a scholarship from IKEA Foundation in 2004

and 2006. Since then I gave few talks and workshops in Switzerland and France on topics such as locative media arts, new

media and mapping. As a designer I work in the field of graphic and web design along with contributing to research projects

and events organization that are related to new media arts. Formerly professor for typography at the School of Applied

Arts in La Chaux-de-Fonds from 2001 to 2009. Currently teaching graphic and media design as head of the Media Design

master program at Head–Geneva and as a regular lecturer at the School of Visual Arts in Biel/Bienne. Since september

		<string>Born in Poughkeepsie, NY, Sophi Kravitz is an American artist. Early in her career she studied sculpture and bronze casting while building props and FX for movies (if it was a bleeding body part on TV in the 90s, she may have made it). Kravitz was a studio assistant to Jeff Koons, who she highly admires and considers a huge influence on her work.
Later, needing to make a living, she called on her science side and pursued an education, and then a career in engineering. She worked on room-sized process equipment and robotics large and small.
Kravitz’s works can be found primarily as temporary public interactive art. She currently lives and works near New York City, in the Hudson Valley.</string>
