		<string>Trained as an architect, Pablo Garcia’s recent work has evolved from design-for-hire to internationally exhibited artworks, provocations and research studies. Born in 1975, Garcia was in college when the first internet browser launched. Composite training in traditional analog and then-nascent digital technologies inspired a research practice into the intersection and overlap of art and technology, obsolescence and the cutting edge, the real and the virtual. Garcia’s work ranges from scholarly contributions to art historical studies to contemporary artworks examining digital culture.
His expertise in the history and technique of drawing technologies has contributed to research for institutions such as The Art Institute of Chicago, The American Philosophical Society, The Polytechnic Museum (Moscow), and The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (London). Garcia’s work has been exhibited in galleries and festivals across North America, South America, and Europe. His work has also been featured in the most widely-read journals in the world, including Art in America, WIRED, FastCompany, Huffington Post, GQ, Mashable. Garcia’s Core77 Award winning NeoLucida (in collaboration with Golan Levin) was among the Top 100 highest grossing Kickstarter campaigns of all time. Previously, Garcia has taught at Carnegie Mellon University, Parsons School of Design, and The University of Michigan. He holds degrees in architecture from Cornell and Princeton Universities. Universities.

		<string>Romain Tardy is a visual artist, and focuses his work primarily in digital arts.
Born on September 23, 1984, in Paris, he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts before working for various animation and post-production studios in Paris. He also worked as a VJ at numerous events in France and across Europe, which led him to further examine the complex connections between sound and image. With this experience,Tardy, along with three other artists, created the European visual label Antivj in 2008, which formed the base of his research and work on projected light and its in uence on perception. He remained one of the label’s main artists until late 2013.
His installations, which often use the technique of videomapping, are conceived as tangible experiences in situ and use light as a way to enhance existing architecture or original structures. By examining our relationship to reality as we are confronted by computer imagery and the social changes that it triggers, as well as the way that digital technology is situated in public space,Tardy’s installations seek to evoke these current issues through a poetic approach. His work has been exhibited in more than 15 countries, including France, Sweden,The Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, UK, Czech Republic, Belgium, China, South Korea, Japan, Mexico, USA (New York), Cuba…</string>

		<string>Gael Hugo is a swiss interactive designer established in Paris in 2005, where he’s running « one more studio » since 2009. Starting to play with web technologies in the early 2000s, his design practice aims to reflect the blurry boundaries of visual communication at a digital age. From experimental interactive projects to institutional communication, from Art installation to commercial product design, he likes to produce dedicated design solution relayed by dubious self-made tools to achieve unexpected visual experience in a large range of disciplines.
This experimental and playful way to work gave him the opportunity to create unique projects with musicians (Breakbot, Philippe Cohen-Solal/Gotan Project), cultural institutions (Gaîté Lyrique, Van Gogh museum, Google Cultural Institute), plasticians (Mrzyk &amp; Moriceau) or commercial brands (Chanel, Hermes, Samsung) among others.
Since 2006, he’s a regular professor at ECAL/University of art and design Lausanne, in the Media and Interaction Design unit (M&amp;ID) and part-time lecturer at Parsons School for Design for AMT (Art, Media &amp; Technology) where he teaches both workshops and mentoring sessions in Advanced Interaction, Network Related Design and Experimental Game Design.</string>

		<string>Karsten Schmidt is an award-winning London based computational designer and researcher merging code, design, art &amp; craft skills. Originally from East Germany and starting in the deep end of the early 8-bit demo scene, for the past 25+ years he’s been adopting a completely trans-disciplinary way of working and has been laterally involved in a wide range of creative disciplines. With his practice PostSpectacular, he’s been actively exploring current possibilities at the intersection of design, art, software development and education and applying this mixture hands-on to a variety of fields, from architecture, branding, digital fabrication, interactive installations, motion graphics &amp; music. A strong conceptual thinker and always striving for maximum creative freedom, Karsten’s design approach is based on treating ideas as malleable software at the heart, which in turn informs all other facets of each project.
When not creating, he regularly travels the world consulting, lecturing and teaching workshops about code literacy, open source and employing code as creative tool. He is a prolific contributor to several large open source projects, was an early contributor to the Processing.org project and to several books about programming and graphic design. His work has been featured and exhibited internationally, including the MoMA New York, Design Museum, Barbican Centre and Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

		<string>Refik Anadol is a media artist and director born in Istanbul, Turkey. Currently lives and works in Los Angeles, California. He is a lecturer in UCLA’s Department of Design Media Arts.
He is working in the fields of site-specific public art with parametric data sculpture approach and live audio/visual performance with immersive installation approach, particularly his works explore the space among digital and physical entities by creating a hybrid relationship between architecture and media arts.
As a media artist, designer and spatial thinker, Refik Anadol is intrigued by the ways in which the transformation of the subject of contemporary culture requires rethinking of the new aesthetic, technique and dynamic perception of space. Anadol builds his works on the nomadic subject’s reaction to and interactions with unconventional spatial orientations. Embedding media arts into architecture, he questions the possibility of a post digital architectural future in which there are no more non-digital realities. He invites the viewers to visualize alternative realities by presenting them the possibility of re-defining the functionalities of both interior and exterior architectural formations. Anadol’s work suggests that all spaces and facades have potentials to be utilized as the media artists’ canvases.
He has been given awards, residencies and has served as a guest lecturer. He is the recipient of a number of awards, prizes including Microsoft Research’s Best Vision Awards, UCLA Art+Architecture Moss Awards, The University of California Institute for Research in the Arts Awards and CODAvideo Awards. His site-specific audio/visual performances have been seen in Walt Disney Concert Hall (USA), Hammer Museum (USA), International Digital Arts Biennial Montreal (Canada), Ars Electronica Festival (Austria), l’Usine | Genève (Switzerland), Arc De Triomf (Spain), Zollverein | SANAA’s School of Design Building (Germany), santralistanbul Contemporary Art Center (Turkey), Outdoor Vision Festival SantaFe New Mexico (USA), Istanbul Design Biennial (Turkey), Sydney City Art (Australia), Lichtrouten (Germany).

		<string>Tom “Squarepusher” Jenkinson makes manic, schizoid, experimental drum’n’bass with a heavy progressive jazz influence and a lean toward pushing the clichés of the genre out the proverbial window. Rising from near-total obscurity to drum’n’bass cause célèbre in the space of a couple of months, Jenkinson released only a pair of EPs and a DJ Food remix for the latter’s Refried Food series before securing EP and LP release plans with three different labels. His first full-length work, Feed Me Weird Things (on Richard “Aphex Twin” James’ Rephlex label), was a dizzying, quixotic blend of super-fast jungle breaks with Aphex-style synth textures, goofy, offbeat melodies, and instrumental arrangements (he samples his own playing for his tracks) that vaguely recall jazz fusion pioneers such as Mahavishnu Orchestra and Weather Report. A skilled bassist and multi-instrumentalist, Jenkinson’s fretless accompaniment is a staple of his music and one of the more obvious affiliations with jazz (although his formal arrangements are often as jazz-derived as his playing).
Jenkinson grew up listening to jazz and dub greats like Miles Davis, Augustus Pablo, Charlie Parker, and Art Blakey. The son of a jazz drummer, Jenkinson followed in his father’s footsteps, playing bass and drums in high school. Introduced to electronic music through experimental electro-techno artists such as LFO and Carl Craig, Jenkinson soon began assembling his disparate influences into amalgams of breakbeat techno and post-bop avant-garde and progressive jazz. Claiming a closer affinity with jazz than jungle (although he draws from both equally in his music), Jenkinson’s EPs as Squarepusher and the Duke of Harringay (Jenkinson moved to Harringay from his Chelmsford birthplace) were initially disregarded as misplaced perversions of jungle’s more obvious compositional principles, but found ready audiences in fans of post-acid house experimental listening music. He inked a deal with Warp in 1995, releasing the Port Rhombus EP and three others through a variety of different labels. The aforementioned full-length Feed Me Weird Things appeared in 1996, followed a year later by Hard Normal Daddy.
Critical acclaim for Jenkinson’s work peaked with 1998’s Music Is Rotted One Note, for which he became a one-man fusion group — multi-tracking himself playing drums, bass, and keyboards. The following year, he released two EPs (Budakhan Mindphone, Maximum Priest) and another full LP, Selection Sixteen. Go Plastic appeared in summer 2001, featuring the closest thing to a hit Squarepusher had ever seen with the single “My Red Hot Car.” Subsequent releases such as 2003’s Do You Know Squarepusher and 2004’s Ultravisitor found him refining his fusion of composition, programming, and musicianship, characteristics that were also heard on 2006’s Hello Everything and 2008’s Just a Souvenir. After a record of solo bass (titled Solo Electric Bass, Vol. 1), he unveiled his next project, a masked foursome named Shobaleader One that released a 2010 collaboration album (Shobaleader One: D’demonstrator) consisting of throwback electronic pop with an R&amp;B edge and synthesized vocals, not unlike Daft Punk. In 2012, Jenkinson returned with the coldly symphonic Ufabulum, adding an apocalyptic soundtrack feel to his already dense programming. In 2013, he worked with a team of Japanese roboticists on an ambitious project called Z-Machines, the creation of robots that could play music far beyond the capabilities of even the most skilled human instrumentalists. Jenkinson aided the robotics team in the composition of music for these robots to play, set to life by a 22-armed drumming robot and a guitar-playing robot with the equivalent of 78 fingers. The next year, Warp Records released the Music for Robots EP, a five-song recording of the results of the experiment. 2015 saw the release of Damogen Furies, a full-length that found Jenkinson pushing the limits of even his own unbridled hysteria, employing punishing overdriven tones on almost every beat, synth, and bassline on the album.</string>

		<string>The European Network for Contemporary Audiovisual Creation aims to foster innovation based on a combination of the knowledge, experience and resources of its members, an interdisciplinary and complementary vision. Their contribution to the process of creators, in the fields of research, production, education and dissemination of the new audiovisual practices will result in a more effective implementation of innovative solutions that can be exported, that are sustainable and that bring the new audiovisual culture closer to the general public and to the audiovisual industry. Furthermore, the network will foster interaction and collaborative work among European creators/developers fostering and boosting intermedia research.Training is considered a strategic pillar of this project at different levels with the purpose of boosting the capabilities of creators reinforcing and supporting their knowledge and skills thus extending their contribution to the various creative and cultural industries and, with the firm purpose of extending the critical mass and bringing these practices closer to a larger audience, based on collective participation and critical reflection through actions that make us re-think the environment that we inhabit. Furthermore, the aim is to explore how these advancements can develop and trascend to industries that are not merely cultural or creative. 6 European partners from 5 countries (Spain, France, Serbia, Germany and Austria) and 4 non-European collaborating partners based in Switzerland, Canada and Mexico, the project will include the following actions: 20 research and production residencies, 12 series of expert training workshops, 2 developer and creator meetings and 24 public presentations of the results by means of performances, installations and/or exhibitions, in addition to talks, conferences and round tables to share the processes and debate important issues for the network and its audiences.</string>

		<string>We, 8 major European events are pleased to introduce you to We are Europe, our newly-created association. We are Europe is about joining forces in order to promote, create and produce innovative cultural practices, defined by creative diversity and exchange.
In today’s Europe, tempted by distrust, populism and all forms of radicalization, civic and social crisis, but also decreasing cultural fundings, we, as We are Europe, want to provide a European contribution and represent an open, innovative, creative Europe united in its values and beliefs, but strong in its diversity.
Our collaborative project gathers together c/o pop (Cologne, Germany), Elevate (Graz, Austria), Insomnia (Tromsø, Norway), Nuits sonores (Lyon, France), Resonate (Belgrade, Serbia), Reworks (Thessaloniki, Greece), Sónar (Barcelona, Spain) and TodaysArt (The Hague, Netherlands) and aims to develop a prospective vision of electronic culture, technology and entrepreneurship, contributing to positive new social and political developments with an interdisciplinary approach.
From 2016 to 2018, we are going to contribute to the exchange and the mobility of artists, works and ideas across the European continent.
Electronic, digital, contemporary, innovative: the culture we represent bring together European communities, throughout a rich and diverse array of aesthetics, high artistic standards and supporting a culture of sharing and collaboration.
For three years, we will present 56 artistic stages and co-creations in the 8 European partner countries and debate and exchange on annual thematics.
The annual topic for 2016 is: cultural entrepreneurship.

		<string>Patricio Gonzalez Vivo is an artist and engineer who uses code and light to turn data into stunning landscapes. His landscapes address the problem of scale and the development of technology to perceive beyond the world in front of us. This technology helps us to see where our eyes are otherwise blind, pushing our cognitive limits. Patricio’s landscapes are not just representations of space but compositions of time and perception. Although his work is technically sophisticated his process is driven by curiosity and playful tinkering. Binoculars, telescopes, astrolabes, compasses, grids, maps, and photographs are some of the apparatus that trigger his imagination.
Patricio’s work has been shown at FILE Festival (2012, 2013), Espacio Fundación Telefónica, and FASE. He was a MediaLab resident at Centro Cultural Español. Patricio currently makes open source mapping tools at Mapzen. His work has been featured in Gizmodo, The Atlantic, and Fast Company. He developed visual systems for the interactive Clouds documentary. He teaches at Parsons, where he received his MFA in Design and Technology.
Patricio lives in Brooklyn and Buenos Aires. In his previous life he was a clinical psychologist and art therapist. He believes in developing a better together.</string>

		<string>Born in Poughkeepsie, NY, Sophi Kravitz is an American artist. Early in her career she studied sculpture and bronze casting while building props and FX for movies (if it was a bleeding body part on TV in the 90s, she may have made it). Kravitz was a studio assistant to Jeff Koons, who she highly admires and considers a huge influence on her work.
Later, needing to make a living, she called on her science side and pursued an education, and then a career in engineering. She worked on room-sized process equipment and robotics large and small.
Kravitz’s works can be found primarily as temporary public interactive art. She currently lives and works near New York City, in the Hudson Valley.</string>
